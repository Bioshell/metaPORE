MetaPORE â€“ Chiu laboratory, University of California, San Francisco

MetaPORE is described in [this] (http://www.genomemedicine.com/content/7/1/99) manuscript.

The code contained within this repository is the bioinformatics pipeline MetaPORE, as used to analyze Nanopore Minion data in the above manuscript.

This code has been tested with the Metrichor 2D Basecalling v1.14 pipeline, which has since been updated. Over the next several weeks, we will test functionality with newer versions of Metrichor, and provide documentation in order to simplify the installation procedure.

Please submit an issue with any requests.
